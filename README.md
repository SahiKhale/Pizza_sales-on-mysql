ABOUT DATASET:
The dataset used is synthetic, representing pizza sales from a pizza place in the U.S. It includes details on 32 different pizzas categorized into four types: classic, chicken, supreme, and veggie. Each record in the dataset captures details such as the order ID, date, time, pizza name, size, type, and price.

Purpose of the project:
The main purpose of the project is to apply SQL queries for various analyses, such as:

• Fetching specific records (e.g., pizzas with a certain price or type).
• Modifying the table (e.g., renaming columns, adding primary and foreign keys).
• Performing operations using functions like ceil(), floor(), and date functions like NOW().
• Executing subqueries and creating views.
